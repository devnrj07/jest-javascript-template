## Template code for a basic Javascript setup with Jest for TDD

In order to get this project up and running, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository/download it as a zip file
2. Open a terminal and change directories into the folder for this project
3. Make sure you have node and npm installed (run `node -v` and `npm -v`)
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`to install the packages that this project needs
5. Run `node index.js` to run index.js file
6. Run `npm run test` or `yarn run test` to run all your test cases written in test.js file
7. Alternatively, you can run jest in `watch` mode by running -> `npm run test -- --watch` or   `yarn run test --watch`.
NOTE : for this to work your directory must be git initialized `git init`
